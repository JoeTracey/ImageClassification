# ResNet/
ResNet/ contains my own implimentation of a ResNet50 based on the arcitecture described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385

In order to test the models ability to both bound and classify image data, I have used the public dataset MIT http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
- Image Data http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/images.tar
- Annotation Data http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/annotation.tar


#To Do
-add assessment on test data
-add batch size
-add bounding box training
